Hi, I'm Keith Wylie, an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Flagler College. I'm a legal psychologist with a background in cognitive, social, and quantitative psychology. I earned my Ph.D. in Legal Psychology from Florida International University and completed my undergrad work at University of Central Florida. Before coming to Flagler, I was an Assistant Professor at Emporia State University (stingers up!).

I've had the opportunity to teach foundational psychology courses in Research Methods, Statistics, Social Psychology, and Cognition. I've also developed fun specialized courses, including Legal Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Psychology of Language, and Psychology of Pseudoscience. My focus is on project-based learning, where students apply what they learn to real-world situations, making the science of psychology both engaging and practical.

My research covers a range of topics including eyewitness memory, juror decision-making, misinformation, and how people think about their own thinking (metacognition). My students and I have shared our work at conferences across the country and in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.
