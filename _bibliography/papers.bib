abstract = {Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are life-changing events that can contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, both of which are closely associated with poor overall outcomes. Brain injury may impact cognitive and physiological functions, regulation of mood, interpersonal relationships, personal identity, and self-esteem. Studies have demonstrated benefits of art therapy interventions with the TBI population that could help with recovery. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an art therapy intervention involving creating a collage could decrease self-reported anxiety in adult participants with a TBI. Through a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test single group design, the researcher gathered quantitative data using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results indicated a significant decrease in State Anxiety scores (t(7) = 6.76, p < .001) and a significant decrease in Trait Anxiety scores (t(7) = 3.06, p = .018) between the pre-and post-test. The results of this pilot study demonstrated a significant reduction of anxiety in participants following pictorial collage intervention in a single art therapy session. The potency of even brief engagement in art therapy experiences supports the use and benefit of art therapy with individuals with TBI.}

	abstract = {Best practice eyewitness interviewing mnemonics have not been tested with linguistically diverse samples. Cognitively complex mnemonics may overload non-native speakers’ cognitive resources, which are already engaged in speaking a non-native language. Social facilitation mnemonics may help non-native speakers, who might be hesitant to report details. The current study tested the reverse order mnemonic (cognitively complex) and a set of introductory instructions (social facilitation) compared to control interviews among native and non-native English speakers. Native speakers provided more details than nonnative speakers, particularly in the control interview condition. Both the reverse order and control conditions elicited newly generated details because of repeated questioning. Accuracy rates were comparable across language and interview conditions. Future research should develop an interviewing protocol that is sensitive to the challenges faced by nonnative speakers.},

	abstract = {As immigration and homeland security become of greater concern both at a global and national level, it is imperative to review existing research on observers' ability to accurately detect deception in non-native speakers. Objectives of this systematic review were to summarise the evidence on adult observers' ability to accurately detect deception in non-native speakers compared to native speakers; identify response biases in observers' judgements when judging native versus non-native speakers' statements; and explore whether differences in observers' deception detection accuracy varies across targets' proficiency levels. Two reviewers independently searched five databases and screened for all quantitative studies that met pre-selected search criteria. Out of 1885 records identified through database searching, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Discriminability for non-native speakers was above chance in four samples. Most studies found support for a lie bias when judging non-native speakers and a truth bias when judging native speakers. In addition to further research, these results highlight the need for better reporting of stimuli and observer samples as well as a standardised measure of individuals' proficiency level.},

	abstract = {The self-concept maintenance theory holds that many people will cheat in order to maximize self-profit, but only to the extent that they can do so while maintaining a positive self-concept. Mazar, Amir, and Ariely (2008, Experiment 1) gave participants an opportunity and incentive to cheat on a problem-solving task. Prior to that task, participants either recalled the Ten Commandments (a moral reminder) or recalled 10 books they had read in high school (a neutral task). Results were consistent with the self-concept maintenance theory. When given the opportunity to cheat, participants given the moral-reminder priming task reported solving 1.45 fewer matrices than did those given a neutral prime (Cohen’s d = 0.48); moral reminders reduced cheating. Mazar et al.’s article is among the most cited in deception research, but their Experiment 1 has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the aggregated result of 25 direct replications (total N = 5,786), all of which followed the same preregistered protocol. In the primary meta-analysis (19 replications, total n = 4,674), participants who were given an opportunity to cheat reported solving 0.11 more matrices if they were given a moral reminder than if they were given a neutral reminder (95\% confidence interval = [−0.09, 0.31]). This small effect was numerically in the opposite direction of the effect observed in the original study (Cohen’s d = −0.04).},

	abstract = {Finding communication strategies that effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-country, preregistered experiment (
              n
              = 25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of social distancing messages that promoted personal agency and reflective choices (i.e., an autonomy-supportive message) or were restrictive and shaming (i.e., a controlling message) compared with no message at all. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses in that the controlling message increased controlled motivation (a poorly internalized form of motivation relying on shame, guilt, and fear of social consequences) relative to no message. On the other hand, the autonomy-supportive message lowered feelings of defiance compared with the controlling message, but the controlling message did not differ from receiving no message at all. Unexpectedly, messages did not influence autonomous motivation (a highly internalized form of motivation relying on one’s core values) or behavioral intentions. Results supported hypothesized associations between people’s existing autonomous and controlled motivations and self-reported behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing. Controlled motivation was associated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intention to engage in social distancing, whereas autonomous motivation was associated with less defiance and more short- and long-term intentions to social distance. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication, with implications for the current and future global health challenges.},

	abstract = {Srull and Wyer (1979) demonstrated that exposing participants to more hostility-related stimuli caused them subsequently to interpret ambiguous behaviors as more hostile. In their Experiment 1, participants descrambled sets of words to form sentences. In one condition, 80\% of the descrambled sentences described hostile behaviors, and in another condition, 20\% described hostile behaviors. Following the descrambling task, all participants read a vignette about a man named Donald who behaved in an ambiguously hostile manner and then rated him on a set of personality traits. Next, participants rated the hostility of various ambiguously hostile behaviors (all ratings on scales from 0 to 10). Participants who descrambled mostly hostile sentences rated Donald and the ambiguous behaviors as approximately 3 scale points more hostile than did those who descrambled mostly neutral sentences. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 26 independent replications ( N = 7,373 in the total sample; k = 22 labs and N = 5,610 in the primary analyses) of Srull and Wyer’s Experiment 1, each of which followed a preregistered and vetted protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that the protagonist was seen as 0.08 scale points more hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.16]). The ambiguously hostile behaviors were seen as 0.08 points less hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% CI = [−0.18, 0.01]). Although the confidence interval for one outcome excluded zero and the observed effect was in the predicted direction, these results suggest that the currently used methods do not produce an assimilative priming effect that is practically and routinely detectable.},
