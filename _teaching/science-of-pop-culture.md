**course description**  
This course uses the art and culture of drag as a vivid case study in how social scientists investigate identity, performance, and meaning. Drag brings together questions about gender, self-expression, creativity, and social influence—making it a perfect phenomenon for illustrating how psychology helps us understand culture itself.  

I was especially excited to zoom into one particular phenomenon of pop culture—drag—to show how social scientific inquiry can be both rigorous and deeply engaging. Students examine how performers construct and communicate identity, how audiences interpret and respond to those performances, and how drag intersects with topics such as stigma, resilience, and representation.

**sample learning objectives**  
- Apply psychological theories of gender, identity, and performance to the art and culture of drag.  
- Analyze drag as a site of social learning, creativity, and resistance.  
- Evaluate empirical studies on media representation, stigma, and community belonging.  
- Communicate research insights in accessible and creative formats.
