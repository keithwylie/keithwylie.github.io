**course description**  
How does memory workâ€”and how can we make it work for us? We cover models of memory, metacognition, autobiographical memory, knowledge, and applications to domains like learning and law.

**sample learning objectives**  
- Describe major models (e.g., multi-store, working memory, levels of processing).  
- Critique and synthesize empirical findings.  
- Connect memory research to practice (education, interviewing, health).  
- Propose an experiment or systematic review.

**resources i reference**  
- Primary journal articles and handbook chapters.  
- Readings on metacognition, overconfidence, and memory control.

**sample learning activities / assessments**  
- Reading annotations and student-led discussions.  
- Short analytic essays (choose-your-own prompts).  
- Term project (experimental proposal or applied product).
